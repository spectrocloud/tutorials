## Intermediate Pattern

The intermediate pattern of managing and maintain cluster profiles. Each cluster profile version is defined through a single `spectrocloud_cluster_profile` resource. Terraform logic is applied to achieve unique cluster profile versions.


| Pros |
| ---- |
| Reduces code duplication |
| Adding new versions is a low complexity task|




| Cons |
| ---- |
| Requires more complex Terraform logic |
| Difficult to understand |
| Removing versions is difficult as cluster profiles are recreated. This us due to state being maintained in a list. |
| YAML customization not supported. Additional logic is required to support YAML customization. |


## Usage


1. List the number of versions desired in the `locals.cp-versions`  variable.

```hcl
cp-versions    = ["1.0.0", "1.0.1", "1.0.3"]
```

2. List each versions pack name and pack version in the `locals.cp-packs` variable.

```hcl
  packs = {
    "1.0.0" = {
      "csi-aws-ebs" = "1.22.0"
      "cni-calico"  = "3.26.1"
      "kubernetes"  = "1.27.5"
      "ubuntu-aws"  = "22.04"
    }
    "1.0.1" = {
      "csi-aws-ebs" = "1.24.0"
      "cni-calico"  = "3.26.1"
      "kubernetes"  = "1.27.5"
      "ubuntu-aws"  = "22.04"
    }
    "1.0.3" = {
      "csi-aws-ebs"    = "1.24.0"
      "cni-cilium-oss" = "1.14.3"
      "kubernetes"     = "1.28.3"
      "ubuntu-aws"     = "22.04"
    }
  }

```

3. Add a data resouce for each defined pack. Replace the name of the pack with the name of the pack you are adding. For example, if you are adding the `csi-aws-ebs` pack, the data resource would look like the following:

```hcl
data "spectrocloud_pack" "csi-aws-ebs" {
  count        = length([for version, pack in local.packs : version if contains(keys(pack), "csi-aws-ebs")])
  name         = "csi-aws-ebs"
  version      = [for version, pack in local.packs : pack["csi-aws-ebs"] if contains(keys(pack), "csi-aws-ebs")][count.index]
  registry_uid = data.spectrocloud_registry.public_registry.id
}
```


4. Add a local variable that contains a reference to the respective data resource.  This is required for the dynamic behavior of the `spectrocloud_cluster_profile` resource. Add or remove packs as needed.

```hcl
  pack_data = {
    "csi-aws-ebs" = {
      data_source = data.spectrocloud_pack.csi-aws-ebs
    }
    "cni-calico" = {
      data_source = data.spectrocloud_pack.cni-calico
    }
    "kubernetes" = {
      data_source = data.spectrocloud_pack.kubernetes
    }
    "ubuntu-aws" = {
      data_source = data.spectrocloud_pack.ubuntu-aws
    }
    "cni-cilium-oss" = {
      data_source = data.spectrocloud_pack.cni-cilium-oss
    }
  }
```


5. Specify the desired cluster profile version when deploying a cluster. You can use a target variable or manually specify the version. In the example below, the target variable `target_version` is used.


```hcl
cluster_profile {
    id = spectrocloud_cluster_profile.aws-profile[index(local.cp-versions, local.target_version)].id
  }
```
